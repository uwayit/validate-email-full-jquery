# validate email full jquery

This set of functions allows you to significantly reduce the number of incorrectly entered emails, especially on projects where there is an increased number of users who are not well versed in the Internet.

Some of the most common micro errors are corrected silently and automatically without distracting the user, thanks to the experience gained over several years in real projects, after which the function returns the corrected version and accepts it as valid:  
gmeil.com  
qmail.com  
gmail.con  
mail.ya  
ykr.met  
yandx.ry  
and thousands of other combinations are corrected to be correct.  

At the same time, it seems important to prevent multiple registrations from the same email.  
For this purpose, we remove from email all tricks that can allow users to use it many times.  
**Тобто:**    
my.Email+wOrk@googlemail.COM  
**We clean to its root**  
myemail@gmail.com
